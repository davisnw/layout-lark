Experiments in html/css/js layouts

Not necessarily recommended for production usage...

Goal: Fixed "callout" on left side with fixed header.  Callout offset on centered content.
As window shrinks horizontally, side bar should remain visible. This experiment uses javascript and avoids media queries.

Doesn't work correctly in all browsers (especially bad in FireFox 55 - appears to be javascript error)
