Experiments in html/css/js layouts

Not necessarily recommended for production usage...

Goal: Fixed "callout" on left side with fixed header.  Callout offset on centered content.
As window shrinks horizontally, side bar should remain visible. This experiment uses javascript and avoids media queries.
